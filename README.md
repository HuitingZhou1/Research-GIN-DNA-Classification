# Research-GIN-DNA-Classification

This repository contains research code for DNA classification using Graph Isomorphism Networks (GIN). The main goal of this project is to classify DNA sequences through the application of GIN models.

## Features
- Implementation of GIN for DNA classification
- Data preprocessing for DNA sequence representation as graph structures
- Model training and evaluation scripts
- Experiment results and visualization
